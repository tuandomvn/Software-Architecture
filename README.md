# Chapter 1: Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture

*Software Architect responsibility*:
-Defining a software development process
-Gather the software requirements
**Gather the right information to design high-quality software**
*Purpose:* do not write requirements just for the user, write them for you and your team too
Time invested in requirements analysis is time invested in better code later.
*Requirements engineering process*
- Elicitation: detecting exact user needs, using common techniques:
		- The power of imagination
		- Questionnaires
		- Interviews
		- Observation
- Analyzing requirements: using common techniques:
		- Prototyping: clarify and materialize the system requirements, using Pencil Project or Figma
		- Use cases: using UML or Lucidchart
- Writing the specifications: using traditional requirements, or user stories (Agile)
		- All stakeholders need to understand, include non-technicians
		- Write functional and non-functional requirements (scalability, robustness, security, and performance)
		- User stories sample: As \<user>, I want \<feature>, so that \<reason>
- Reviewing the specification: present prototype, documents to all stateholders

**Using design techniques as a helpful tool**
In some cases customer does not know the best solution for the problem.
Design techniques: Design Thinking and Design Sprint, to defining a solution, technology

- Design Thinking: 
	- To collect data directly from the users, focusing on achieving the best results to solve a problem. Discover all the personas
	- Process: 
		- Empathize: research to discover usersâ€™ concerns, understand why and for whom you are developing
		- Define: define their needs to solve them
		- Ideate: brainstorm some possible solutions.
		- Prototype: develope mock-ups to confirm
		- Test: to understand the prototype that is most connected to the real needs of the users.
	- The prototype process will help stakeholders to understand the final product and, at the same time, engage the team to deliver the best solution
- Design Sprint
